**I added 4 Scenarios On Footer Links and Social Links Availability and Functionality:

Scenario_1: Check All Footer Links Availability

Scenario_2: Check Footer Links Are Active

Scenario_3: Check Twitter Link Is Active & Redirect To The Page

 Scenario_4: Check Facebook Link Is Active &      Redirect To The Page
  
**Also I added one generic method on Master Page-
selectItemFromDropDownByIndex
